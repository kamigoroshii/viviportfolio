           I'm a second-year B.Tech student at VNR VJIET, specializing in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I'm currently diving deep into Data Structures and Algorithms while also exploring frontend development. Most days, you'll find me glued to my laptop â€” planning to build something new, only to be greeted by a few unexpected errors. But every bug is a learning curve, and I'm committed to growing through it all. With a strong interest in programming, intelligent systems, and software development, I'm passionate about building meaningful tech solutions and constantly improving both my technical and problem-solving skills.
